FREQUENCY 500HZ
1 pulse = 1/500 Hz = 2 msec
1msec ON time and 1msec OFF time.
Crystal Frequency = 11.0592 MHz
1 clock pulse = 1.085 μsec.
Count = 1000 μsec /1.085 μsec = 921.6589
Counter initial value = 65536 - 922 = 646 = FC67


FREQUENCY 7kHZ
1 pulse = 1/7kHz = 0.142msec
71 μsec ON time and 71 μsec OFF line.
Crystal Frequency = 11.0592MHz
1 clock pulse = 1.085μsec.
Count = 71μsec/1.085 μsec = 64.43
Counter initial value = 256 - 64 = 192= 0C00
